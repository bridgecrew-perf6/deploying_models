tf.Example,the data structure representing every data row within
tfrecord is also the default data structure in the tensorflw ecosystem and 
, therefore is used in all TFX components.

To convert data of anytype to tfrecord files, we need to create a 
tf.Example structure for every data record in the dataset. tf.Example
 is a key-value ,mapping:
        {"string": value}

tf.Example expects a tf.Featurs object, which accepts a dictionary
of features containing key-value pairs. The key is always a string
identifier representing the feature column and the value is a 
tf.train.feature object:
        {"column A": tf.train.feature}

tf.train.feature allows three data types:
        tf.train.Byteslist
        tf.train.Floatlist
        tf.train.Int64list
